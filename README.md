Repository contains programs written in Jupyter Notebooks for a final project detailing strange attractors
in satisfactory completion of the [PHYS 106] - Nonlinear Dynamics course at UCSB.
Also includes the final report StrangeAttractors.pdf file.

Descriptions

1. HenonMap.ipynb
  notebook that reproduces the results detailed in Henon's 1976 paper 
  'A two-dimensional mapping with a strange attractor'

2. henonquadraticmap.ipynb
  functions defining and plotting Henon's quadratic area-preserving map from
  a basin of initial conditions

3. lozimap.ipynb
  functions recreating the Lozi iterated map, exhibiting chaos on a strange
  attractor similar to Henon's mapping

4. standardmap.ipynb
  functions defining and plotting the area-preserving standard map, also known
  as the Chirikovâ€“Taylor map or the Chirikov standard map, from a basin of
  initial conditions

5. Strogatz12_2_14.ipynb
  notebook containing functions showing the evolution of a rectangle under
  distinct transformations amounting to the Lozi iterated map
